## Theme Brainstorm
For the theme, I’m thinking about doing a coffee shop. I’m not sure what coffee shop to initially base the theme on specifically, but I’m thinking about doing [Bodhi Leaf Coffee](https://www.bodhileafcoffee.com/) because it’s somewhere that I’ve visited often and have a strong idea on their user base.

For the most part, I’ve noticed that young adults and middle-aged parents visit Bodhi so that will be the user base that I will design for too.

The features I want to include is viewing their menu, showcasing their story and mission, featuring seasonal menu items, contact info, and showcasing their coffee beans and other greens. A big part of their brand is teaching people about coffee so I might incorporate that too.

The overall design will be bright, welcoming, and with bouncy typography and illustrative accents.
